About Me
------

I am  a postdoctoral fellow in the [STADIUS Center](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius) of Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT), KU Leuven, Belgium. My postdoc supervisor is Prof. [Rodolphe Sepulchre](https://sites.google.com/site/rsepulchre). My research interests include nonlinear systems, robust control, phase theory and spiking control systems.

I received my B.E. degree (hons) in automation from Zhejiang University of Technology, China, in 2016, and Ph.D. degree in electronic and computer engineering from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Hong Kong, China, in 2022. My Ph.D. supervisor is Prof. [Li Qiu](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/eeqiu). In Oct 2023, my Ph.D. journey was interviewed by [PhDs in Control](https://doi.org/10.1109/MCS.2023.3291899) in *IEEE Control Systems Magazine*. My Ph.D. dissertation is dedicated to answering the following two questions:

 - *What is the phase of a nonlinear system?*
 - *What is the formulation of a nonlinear small phase theorem for feedback stability?*

From 2022 to 2023, I was a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk) (ECE) of HKUST.
