About Me
------
I am a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in Control Systems with the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering, The University of Manchester, United Kingdom. My research interests include nonlinear systems, robust control, phase theory and spiking control systems.

I was a postdoctoral scholarship holder in the [STADIUS Center](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/stadius) of Department of Electrical Engineering (ESAT), KU Leuven, Belgium, under the supervision of Prof. [Rodolphe Sepulchre](https://sites.google.com/site/rsepulchre). Prior to that, I held a postdoctoral fellow position in the Department of Electronic and Computer Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST), Hong Kong, China, under the supervision of Prof. [Li Qiu](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/eeqiu). 

I received my B.E. degree (hons) in automation from Zhejiang University of Technology, China, in 2016, and Ph.D. degree in electronic and computer engineering from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology in 2022. My Ph.D. supervisor is Prof. [Li Qiu](https://ece.hkust.edu.hk/eeqiu). In October 2023, my Ph.D. journey was interviewed by [PhDs in Control](https://doi.org/10.1109/MCS.2023.3291899) in *IEEE Control Systems Magazine*. My Ph.D. dissertation is dedicated to answering the following two questions:

 - *What is the phase of a nonlinear system?*
 - *What is the formulation of a nonlinear small phase theorem for feedback stability?*
